# Monumenta-mixins
Monumenta-paperfork implementation using mixins w/ ignite, targeting `1.20.4`
## TODO
- Verify things work
## Running
Run the `Minecraft Server` task in intellij.

## Access Wideners
The fork of paperweight-userdev used is buggy (translation: I'm a bit lazy), so you need to run `cleanAllPaperweightUserdevCaches` and reload 
in order to apply access wideners.
